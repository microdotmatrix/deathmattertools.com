## 📖 What is Entry Feedback?

Entry Feedback is a collaboration tool that allows organization members to help improve the accuracy of memorial entries. Think of it as a team fact-checking system where you can:

- Suggest corrections to biographical details
- Report errors or missing information
- Help maintain accurate records
- Collaborate with your team on entry quality

**Important:** This is separate from obituary comments, which are for condolences and memories.
