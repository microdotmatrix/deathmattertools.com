## 📋 Deployment Checklist

Before merging to main:

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` to verify no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run `pnpm lint` to check for linting issues
- [ ] Test in local development thoroughly
- [ ] Review all database changes

### Deployment Steps
1. **Merge Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/quotes-scripture-integration
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - `BIBLE_API_KEY` - For scripture.api.bible
   - `STANDS4_UID` - For Stands4.com (if using real API)
   - `STANDS4_TOKENID` - For Stands4.com (if using real API)

3. **Database Migration**
   - Migration already applied locally
   - Will auto-apply in production (Neon Postgres)

4. **Monitor**
   - Check error logs for any issues
   - Test on production environment
   - Monitor API rate limits

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Cannot find module './add-quote-button'"
- **Solution:** TypeScript needs rebuild. Run `pnpm build` or restart TS server.

**Issue:** Search returns no results
- **Solution:** 
  - For scripture: Ensure faith is selected
  - Check API keys in environment variables
  - Check network console for API errors

**Issue:** Quotes not saving
- **Solution:**
  - Verify user is authenticated (Clerk)
  - Check browser console for errors
  - Verify database migration applied

**Issue:** Page not revalidating after save/delete
- **Solution:** Check `revalidatePath()` calls in server actions

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Implemented Optimizations
- ✅ React `cache()` for query memoization
- ✅ Server Components for data fetching
- ✅ Database indexes on `entryId`, `type`, `faith`
- ✅ Lazy loading search dialog (client component)
- ✅ Suspense boundaries for progressive rendering

### Future Optimizations
- Consider pagination for large quote lists
- Cache API responses (Stands4, Bible, Quran)
- Implement virtual scrolling for many results
- Add debouncing to search input

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Server Components** for saved quotes list → Better performance, SEO-friendly
- **Client Components** for search UI → Necessary for interactivity
- **Server Actions** for mutations → Type-safe, secure, no API routes needed
- **Unified API wrapper** → Single interface for multiple search sources

### UX Decisions
- **Modal dialog for search** → Focused experience, doesn't navigate away
- **Inline save button** → Immediate action, clear feedback
- **Confirmation dialog for delete** → Prevent accidental deletions
- **Empty states with CTAs** → Guide users on next steps
- **Usage indicators** → Show where quotes are being used
