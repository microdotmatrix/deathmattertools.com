## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Access Control Matrix

| User Type | Entry View | Entry Edit | Obituary View | Comment | Obituary Edit |
|-----------|------------|------------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| **Creator** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Org Member** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅* | ❌ |
| **Other Org** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **No Org** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

*When `organizationCommentingEnabled = true`

### Multi-Layer Protection

1. **Database Layer**
   ```typescript
   // Org-aware query
   where: or(
     eq(EntryTable.userId, userId),
     eq(EntryTable.organizationId, orgId)
   )
   
   // Owner-only mutation
   where: and(
     eq(EntryTable.id, id),
     eq(EntryTable.userId, userId)
   )
   ```

2. **Route Layer**
   ```typescript
   const access = await getEntryWithAccess(entryId);
   if (!access || !access.canView) {
     notFound();
   }
   ```

3. **UI Layer**
   ```tsx
   {canEdit ? (
     <EntryForm entry={entry} />
   ) : (
     <ReadOnlyView />
   )}
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Manual Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Create Entry in Organization
```
✅ User 1 creates entry in Org A
✅ Entry has organizationId = "org_xxx"
✅ Entry appears in User 1's "My Entries"
```

#### Scenario 2: View as Organization Member
```
✅ User 2 (Org A) sees entry in "Team Entries" tab
✅ Badge shows "Team" with tooltip
✅ Only "View Entry" button shown
✅ Entry page shows "Team Entry (View Only)" badge
✅ Entry form is read-only
✅ No edit/delete buttons on obituaries
```

#### Scenario 3: Access Restrictions
```
✅ User 3 (Org B) does not see entry
✅ Direct access to entry returns 404
✅ User 4 (no org) does not see entry
```

#### Scenario 4: Obituary Access
```
✅ User 2 (Org A) can view obituaries
✅ User 2 can comment (when enabled)
✅ User 2 cannot see edit button

✅ Empty states display correctly
```

### Performance Checks

```bash
# Check database index
SELECT indexname, indexdef 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'v1_entry' 
  AND indexname = 'entry_organization_id_idx';

# Expected: Index exists using btree on organization_id
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Database
- **Index:** `entry_organization_id_idx` (btree) ✅
- **Query Time:** < 50ms (with index)
- **Migration:** Applied successfully

### Page Load Times (Expected)

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Existing Entries
- All entries created before this update have `organizationId = NULL`
- These entries remain **private** to their creators
- No change in behavior for pre-existing entries

### Backfill (Optional)
To share existing entries with organizations:

```sql
-- Backfill organizationId for existing entries
-- Run this carefully with proper WHERE conditions

UPDATE v1_entry
SET organization_id = 'org_xxx'
WHERE user_id IN (
  -- List of user IDs in org_xxx
);
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Only run backfill if users explicitly want to share existing entries.

### Common Questions

**Q: Can organization members edit entries?**  
A: No. Only the creator can edit entries. Org members have view-only access.
