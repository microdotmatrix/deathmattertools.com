## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see team entries"
- Verify you're in an organization
- Verify other members have created entries
- Check the "Team Entries" tab specifically

### "I can't edit a team entry"
- This is expected! Only creators can edit
- You have view-only access for collaboration

### "Commenting doesn't work"
